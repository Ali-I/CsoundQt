Requirements:
- Qt 4 (from www.trolltech.com or your distribution's repository)
- Csound (from www.csounds.com)
- Compiler (mingw for Windows, gcc for GNU/Linux, Xcode for OS X)

Building QuteCsound:

1. Get the sources from http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=227265
2. Execute "qmake" on the src/ dir of the qutecsound sources.
3. On Windows and GNU/Linux execute "make" in the same directory. On Mac, step 2 generates an Xcode project. Build the project in xcode.
4. This provides a working executable which requires Qt to be installed. To create a Windows installer, compile the windows installer (NSIS required http://nsis.sourceforge.net). To create a standalone OS X bundle, enter the bin/ directory where QuteCsound was built and run the script "osx-prepare-bundle.sh".

Enjoy!
