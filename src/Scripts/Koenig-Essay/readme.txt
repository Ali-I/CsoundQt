What is given here is the CSound's realization score for the G.M. Koenig's electronic piece "Essay" (1957), originally composed and realized in the WDR Studio of Koeln.

This is not meant as a substitute for the Koenig's score but as a support for its study and realization. The instruction in the orignial score have been followed the more strictly as possibile. Many reference to the original score are given throughout the various files. The great part of personal interpretation regards the reverberation process and the envelope stages.

The order of the files represents the actual order of operations not that of the score; in this way it is easier to follow the procedure to obtain the final structures which finally build-up the piece.

The 247 CSD files follow the order of the parts of the piece. The format of the names is (for example):

A01_RM01.csd

A, basic material
01, order of the actual transformation process
RM, kind of process
01, number of the actual transformation of the basic material

The labels used for the transformation are the following:

RM: ring-modulation
TR: transposition (resampling)
FILT: filtering
REV: reverberation
ENV: intensity curves
DIST: distortion
CUT: tape cut
TRSM: transposition by means of the Springermaschine

have a nice journey...mine has been very long
